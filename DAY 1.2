Understand about jit compiler and display and layout in tailwind CSS
                                            
                                            <!-- chapter 2  -->
                             <!-- Just-in- time- compiler (JIT)-->

In Tailwind CSS, JIT mode takes a similar approach by dynamically generating styles when they are needed rather than generating all possible styles at build time. 
The JIT mode in TailwindCSS works by parsing your templates on-demand to find the utilities you use. Then it generates the corresponding CSS directly
<h1 class = "text-center font-mono font-extrabold text-[30px]">Hello again</h1>
<!-- dynamic value can give inside square bracket in jit compiler --

                                                        Layout and flex box
                                                        
Most of the time you using  display , position , overflow
1 position :-  positioning define where an element appears relative to its container or the viewport there is a position  of  relative which moves the element to its normal position.
Ex  there are three box (indivual) so we are at middle one so it can move just some left and or some right.
	absolute :- which moves it to the nearest parent.
	Fixed -  position which sticks the element to the viewport so it does not scroll.
Ex  top-0 so it fixed above 
.2 Display :-
Flexbox is important – flexbox in tailwind it dertermine how an element  behaves in term of layout  and visibility within the document . it help to create responsive layouts.
Two important display properties are 
1 flex  (which enables flexbox )
2 grid  ( which enable css grid properties)
Flexbox ---------

<div class = " flex justify-end space-x-6 mt-3">
  <!-- x-6 which will add some spacing in between the element -->
  <!-- justify or align the container to the right -->
  <div class= "h-16 w-16 rounded-full bg-blue-500"></div>
  <div class= "h-16 w-16 rounded-full bg-orange-500"></div>
  <div class= "h-16 w-16 rounded-full bg-yellow-500"></div>
  <!-- h is height -->
  <!-- rounded full to make into a circle -->
  </div>
 <!--  this three circles are in same line but we want in column so
  you can do flex-col -->

  <div class = " flex  flex-col items-center justify-center space-y-6 mt-3">
  <div class= "h-16 w-16 rounded-full bg-blue-500"></div>
  <div class= "h-16 w-16 rounded-full bg-orange-500"></div>
  <div class= "h-16 w-16 rounded-full bg-yellow-500"></div>
  <!--  y is vertical space here -->
  </div>

2:  grid:-  Then  apply  grid … it help to fill space automatically in content.
<!--  grid  -->
<div class = "grid grid-cols-3 gap-2 mt-2 mx-2">
 <div class= "h-16  rounded-full bg-blue-500"></div>
  <div class= "h-16  rounded-full bg-orange-500"></div>
  <div class= "h-16  rounded-full bg-yellow-500"></div>
</div>
