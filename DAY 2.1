                                  Chapter -3 Media Queries and responsive design.
                                  
By default its setting based for  mobile . because tailwind is mobile first .
minwidth  queries will be applied by default.

Note :- 
Don’t use  ‘sm: ’ to target mobile devices.
Use unprefixed utilities to target mobile and override them at larger breakpoints.

code:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div class ="md:block hidden">
  <!--  outer div class of medium devices.(md), block hidden means  is that we will apply display of none but only on medium devices where media width 
  is greater than  or equal to 48 rem which is about 770 pix then we change display to block  so (if i expand it over 768 pix so it will appear in right of the screen..
  ( till 768px  it is hidden then it will be visible. ) -->
  <!--  so these two characters in a colon right(md:) here  are called a  media query. -->
  <!--  Media Queries allow you to change CSS properties depending on the screen width  -->
  <p class = "text"> I appear on screen 1 </p>
</div>

<!-- Using media queries you can change whatever you want let make always visible  but change the text background color depending on different screen sizes  -->
<div class= "sm:bg-amber-500 md:bg-amber-700"> 
  <p class= " text-white"> I appear again 2 </p>
</div>
  <!--  sm is small medium  then changes to medium ( it happen that full screen it is showing color 0f 500 wala then came to 768 pix so color change to 700 wala.) -->
<!--  so summary is that is that larger screen  sizes will always override the smaller  ones ( here medium is being applied beacuse it is greater than 48 rem. ) -->

<!--  using Max md -->
<div class= "max-sm:bg-amber-500 max-md:bg-amber-700"> 
  <!--  it will be applying that only if the width is lower than that specific size -->
  <p class= " text-white"> I appear again 3 </p>
  <!--  after 768px  it will disappear --> 
  <!-- and here we flip the color (700 WALA is showing on full screen) -->
</div>
