Understand about custom styles , reusability and direactive....
                               Custom styles & Reusability 
<!--  let say you want new color and it is not prsent in default css tailwind.  so we can do with differrnt  methods  -->
<!-- 1  Inline -->
<!--  whatever the value is put inside square bracket -->
<p class="text-[#e01c4d] bg-[#1dd836] p-2">Chestnutcolor</p>
<!--  like this you can use for any utility class -->

<p class= "p-[16px] text-[30px] text-[#23df78]
           bg-[#a6ddbf]">More text more fun</p>
 <!-- It have disadvantage is it is for small task. it does not make sence to provide custom values for every single piece of text -->

 <!--  to solve this we have  config it will enable you to control and organize the entire visual style of your application. 
 so use tailwind CSS directives  to write any config you want. this is the biggest changes came in tailwind css so it configuring your project
 in a javascript file  and allow you to configure it directly within css.  -->

 <!--  so we do inside @theme
    for ex add above chestnut color by saying (dash dash) --color-chestnut  -->
 <!--  2 Config -->

<p class= "p-[16px] text-[30px] text-chestnut
<!--  calling chestnut from css file -->
           bg-[#40e98c]">More colors here</p>

<!-- Tailwind css offer directives for each of these to define  specific styles .. Base , component and utilities are part of an approch to structuring
and organizing styles using the configuration file method    -->

<!-- 1  base  -->
<!--  base simply applies styles globally across your project for your element like  h1 or p tags -->

<!--  syntax -->
<!--  @layer base{
       h1{
         font-size: var(--text-2X1);
       }
       h2{
         font-size: var(--text-X1);
       }
} -->

<!-- 2 components -->
<!--  is used to style specific component or reusable UI element like cards Footers and more -->

<!--  3 utilities -->
<!-- which are Atomic styles for individual properties like margin, paddings, typography color and more -->

<!--  we have another Directive called @apply -->
<!--  that inserts tailwind css styles into css -->

<!--  @layer -->
<!-- using these we can create custom styles for base component and utilities ( see code in css file ) -->

<!--  @layer base (layer of base) -->
<!-- it allow you to automatically target specific element  like h1  -->
